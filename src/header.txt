@about 
  ### Hackey-Trackey
  #### What is it?
  A lightweight tracker plugin for REAPER 5.x and up. Hackey-Trackey is a small 
  tracker for visualizing and editing MIDI data within REAPER. Designed to mimick 
  the pattern editor of Jeskola Buzz, this tracker is meant to enable MIDI note 
  entry and effect automation in a tracked manner.

  #### What is it not?
  A sampler. Hackey-Trackey does not handle sample playback. For this you would 
  need to add an additional VST that handles sample playback.
  
  #### How do I use it?
  Select a MIDI object and start the script. Note that scripts can be bound to 
  shortcut keys, which I'd recommend if you're going to be using it. Hit F1 for 
  help on the keys. For more information, please look [here](https://github.com/joepvanlier/Hackey-Trackey).
  
  If you use this plugin and enjoy it let me/others know. If you run into any bugs
  and figure out a way to reproduce them, please open an issue on the plugin's
  github page [here](https://github.com/JoepVanlier/Hackey-Trackey/issues). I would
  greatly appreciate it!
  
  Happy trackin' :)
